I think arrays are a lot of fun and feel confident in learning more about when to implement arrays after completing the lesson assignment.
I don't believe so. For the most part I understand what an array is and the different methods learned so far that change an array. 
Why and when will an array be used and the different methods that change an array? How many array methods does a software engineer know?
